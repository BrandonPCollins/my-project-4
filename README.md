## Agile Development Approach

This video game blog project embraced Agile principles to achieve a flexible and collaborative development process. Divided into three iterations, each represented by a Github Kanban board, the project utilized Github tools for streamlined communication and progress tracking. Custom workflows involving Milestones for Epics and Issues for User Stories provided a structured approach to project organization.

### Dynamic Adaptability and Continuous Improvement

Agile's dynamic prioritization categorized User Stories into 'must do,' 'could do,' and 'should do,' allowing for adaptable planning to accommodate changing project requirements. Despite challenges in pre-planning content due to time constraints, the Agile approach encouraged continuous improvement. The Kanban board visually represented progress, while reflections on completed iterations facilitated insights for refining subsequent cycles, ensuring the successful and flexible development of the video game blog.
